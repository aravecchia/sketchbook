The Max72xx LED Controller IC
-----------------------------
The MAX7219/MAX7221 are compact, serial input/output display drivers that 
interface microprocessors to 7-segment numeric LED displays of up to 8 digits,
bar-graph displays, or 64 individual LEDs. Included on-chip are a BCD code-B 
decoder, multiplex scan circuitry, segment and digit drivers, and an 8x8 static 
RAM that stores each digit.

A convenient 4-wire serial interface (SPI) connects to all common microprocessors.
The devices may be cascaded, with communications passed through the first device 
in the chain to all others.

Individual digits may be addressed and updated without rewriting the entire 
display. The MAX72XX also allow the user to select code-B decoding or no-decode
for each digit.

The devices include
- a 150uA low-power shutdown mode
- analog and digital brightness control
- a scan limit register that allows the user to display from 1 to 8 digits
- a test mode that forces all LEDs on

The Library
-----------
The library implements functions that allow the MAX72xx to be used
for LED matrices (64 individual LEDs), allowing the programmer to use the LED 
matrix as a pixel device, displaying graphics elements much like any other 
pixel addressable display.

In this scenario, it is convenient to abstract out the concept of the hardware device 
and create a uniform and consistent pixel address space, with the libraries determining 
device and device-element address. Similarly, control of the devices should be uniform 
and abstracted to a system level.

The library still retains flexibility for device level control, should the developer 
require, through the use of overloaded class methods.
___

Conditional Compilation Switches
--------------------------------
The library allows the run time code to be tailored through the use of compilation
switches. The compile options starte with USE_ and are documented in the section 
related to the main header file MD_MAX72xx.h.
___

Font Storage Format
-------------------
Fonts are defined as part of the library in PROGMEM memory. The fonts are stored as a 
series of contiguous bytes in the following format:
- byte 1 - the number of bytes that form this character (could be zero)
- byte 2..n - each byte is a column of the character to be formed, starting with the 
leftmost column of the character. The least significant bit of the byte is the bottom 
pixel position of the character matrix (row 7).
 
To find a character in the font table, the library looks at the first byte (size), 
skips 'size'+1 bytes to the next character size byte and repeat until the last or 
target character is reached.

The compile-time switch INDEX_FONT enables indexing of the font table for faster access, at 
the expense of increased RAM usage. If indexing is enabled, a single lookup is required to 
access the character data, rather than the sequential search described above.

The support for fonts (methods and data) may be completely disabled  if not required through 
the compile-time switch INCLUDE_LOCAL_FONT.

\page pageHardware Hardware
Hardware Supported
------------------
This library supports the Parola hardware and the more commonly available LED modules available 
from many low-cost sources. The circuits for the these modules are essentially the same except 
but the LED matrix is oriented differently.

![Parola module] (Parola_Module.png "Parola Module") 
![Generic Module] (Generic_Module.png "Generic Module")

___

Circuit Schematic
-----------------
The schematic is the basic application circuit that is found on the MAX7219 datasheet, 
adapted to the LED matrix. Each Module consists of an 8x8 LED Common Anode matrix
controlled by a MAX7219 LED controller and a few passive components. These controllers 
can be daisy chained, making them ideal for the purpose.

![Parola Circuit Schematic] (Circuit_Schematic.jpg "Module Schematic")

The Parola and generic modules LED matrices are rotated with respect to each other.
This difference is accounted for in software when the type of module is selected 
using the USE_PAROLA_HW compile time switch.
___

Wiring your own matrix
----------------------

How the LED matrix is wired is important for the library. The matrix used for library 
development was a **common anode** type labelled 1088B. Connections should be made as 
described in the table below to be consistent with the assumptions in the software library.
- Columns are addressed through the digits section lines 
- Rows are are addressed through the LED segment selection lines

\page pageConnect System Connections
Module to Arduino Connection (SPI interface)
--------------------------------------------
The modules are connected through a 4-wire serial interface (SPI), and devices are cascaded, 
with communications passed through the first device in the chain to all others. The Arduino 
should be connected to the IN side (shown in the figure below) of the first module in the chain. 

The Arduino interface is implemented with either
+ The hardware SPI interface, or
+ 3 arbitrary digital outputs that are passed through to the class constructor. 

The AVR hardware SPI interface is fast but fixed to predetermined output pins. The more general 
software interface uses the Arduino shiftOut() library function, making it slower but allows the 
use of arbitrary digital pins to send the data to the device. Which mode is enabled depends 
on the class constructor used.

The Arduino interface is implemented with 3 digital outputs that are passed through to 
the class constructor. The digital outputs define the SPI interface as follows:
- DIN (MOSI) - the Data IN signal shifts data into the display module. Data is loaded into 
the device's internal 16-bit shift register on CLK's rising edge.
- CLK (SCK) - the CLocK signal that is used to time the data for the device. 
- LD (SS) - the interface is active when LoaD signal is LOW. Serial data are loaded into the 
device shift register while LOAD is LOW and latched in on the rising edge.

Note that the LD signal is used to select the entire device chain. This allows separate LD 
outputs to control multiple displays sharing the same DIN and CLK signals. The 
software needs to instantiate a separate object for each display.

The remaining interface pins are for +5V and GND. The power supply must be able to supply 
enough current for the number of connected modules. The central position of the Parola GND
connector provides some protection for accidentally reversing the connector.
___

Connecting Multiple Modules
---------------------------
Separate modules are connected by the plugging them together edge to edge, with the 
OUT side of one module plugged to the IN side of the next, as shown in the figures below.

Parola modules are connected by plugging them together.
![Connecting Parola modules] (Parola_conn.jpg "Parola Modules connected")

Generic modules may need to be rotated and connected using short patch cables in a 
spiral pattern.
